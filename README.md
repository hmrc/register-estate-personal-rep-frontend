# Register estate personal rep frontend

This service is responsible for collecting information about the personal representative as part of their estate registration.

To run locally using the micro-service provided by the service manager:

***sm --start ESTATES_ALL -r***

If you want to run your local copy, then stop the frontend ran by the service manager and run your local code by using the following (port number is 8825 but is defaulted to that in build.sbt).

`sbt run`
